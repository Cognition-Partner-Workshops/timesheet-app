# Employee Time Tracking Application

A full-stack web application for tracking and reporting employee hourly work across different clients.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Persistence
- Data is stored in a SQLite file at `backend/data/timesheet.db` by default (set `DATABASE_PATH` to change it, or `:memory:` for a throwaway database; tests use in-memory).
- Schema changes are applied on startup by versioned migrations in `backend/src/database/migrations.js` (tracked with `PRAGMA user_version`). Add a new migration instead of editing a shipped one.
- Foreign keys are enforced (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`).

### Authentication (known risk)
- Login is email-only, with **no password and no token**. The backend trusts the `x-user-email` request header on every call.
- Anyone who knows (or guesses) a user's email can read and change that user's clients, work entries and invoices by sending that header.
- Only run this on a trusted internal network. Replacing it with real authentication (passwords or company SSO) is a separate piece of work.

## Features

- ✅ User login (email only, no password; see the authentication risk above)
- ✅ Add, edit, and delete clients
- ✅ Add, edit, and delete hourly work entries for each client
- ✅ View hourly reports for each client
- ✅ Export hourly reports to CSV or PDF

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Material UI** for components
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API calls

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express
- **SQLite** (file-based, with versioned migrations)
- `x-user-email` header for user identification (no real authentication)
- **Joi** for validation
- **PDFKit** for PDF generation
- **csv-writer** for CSV export

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update `.env` with your configuration:
```bash
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
# Optional: where the SQLite file lives (default: backend/data/timesheet.db)
# DATABASE_PATH=./data/timesheet.db
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend will be running at `http://localhost:3001`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update `.env`:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
2. Enter any email address to log in (no password required)
3. Start adding clients and tracking work hours
4. View reports and export data as CSV or PDF

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with email (creates the user if needed)
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info (requires auth)

### Clients
- `GET /api/clients` - Get all clients
- `POST /api/clients` - Create new client
- `GET /api/clients/:id` - Get specific client
- `PUT /api/clients/:id` - Update client
- `DELETE /api/clients/:id` - Delete client

### Work Entries
- `GET /api/work-entries` - Get all work entries (optional ?clientId filter)
- `POST /api/work-entries` - Create new work entry
- `GET /api/work-entries/:id` - Get specific work entry
- `PUT /api/work-entries/:id` - Update work entry
- `DELETE /api/work-entries/:id` - Delete work entry

### Reports
- `GET /api/reports/client/:clientId` - Get hourly report for client
- `GET /api/reports/export/csv/:clientId` - Export report as CSV
- `GET /api/reports/export/pdf/:clientId` - Export report as PDF

All authenticated endpoints require the `x-user-email` header.

## Security Features

- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- CORS protection
- Helmet security headers
- Input validation with Joi schemas
- SQL injection protection with parameterized queries

## Development

### Backend Development
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev  # Starts with nodemon for auto-reload
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev  # Starts Vite dev server with HMR
```

### Running Tests

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:watch          # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Test Coverage

The backend has comprehensive test coverage with **161 tests** across 8 test suites:

| File | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines |
|------|------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Overall** | **90.16%** | **93.82%** | **92.18%** | **90.35%** |
| database/init.js | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| middleware/auth.js | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| middleware/errorHandler.js | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| routes/auth.js | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| routes/clients.js | 97.89% | 100% | 100% | 97.89% |
| routes/workEntries.js | 98.41% | 100% | 100% | 98.41% |
| routes/reports.js | 64.15% | 69.44% | 68.75% | 64.42% |
| validation/schemas.js | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |

Coverage thresholds are configured in `jest.config.js`:
- Statements: 60%
- Branches: 60%
- Functions: 65%
- Lines: 60%

### Building for Production

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm start  # Production mode
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Creates optimized production build in dist/
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Production Deployment

See `backend/DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed production deployment instructions.

### Quick Production Checklist
- [ ] Restrict network access: email-only login is not real authentication (see Authentication above)
- [ ] Configure proper `FRONTEND_URL` for CORS
- [ ] Put `DATABASE_PATH` on a persistent volume and back it up
- [ ] Set up HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated backups (if using persistent storage)
- [ ] Review and adjust rate limiting settings
- [ ] Consider integrating with company SSO

## Known Limitations

1. **Single SQLite file** - No replication; back up `DATABASE_PATH` yourself
2. **Email-only auth** - No password or token; any caller can act as any user by setting `x-user-email`
3. **No user roles** - All users have equal access to all data
4. **Single-server architecture** - Not designed for horizontal scaling
5. **No real-time updates** - Changes require page refresh

## Future Enhancements

- Persistent database storage
- User roles and permissions
- Multi-tenancy support
- Real-time updates with WebSockets
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Email notifications
- Mobile app
- Integration with calendar systems
